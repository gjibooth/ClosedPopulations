# Preventing SARS-CoV-2 superspreading events with antiviral intranasal sprays
 Figure-generating code for the XX article, "Preventing SARS-CoV-2 superspreading events with antiviral intranasal sprays" by Booth, G et al.

## Reproducing figures
Each figure is produced by a series of Jupyter Notebooks:

* [Figure 3a](cruiseship/simulation/figure3a_intervention_time.ipynb): The impact of time-to-intervention on the number of infections.
* [Figure 3b](cruiseship/simulation/figure3b_coverage_efficacy.ipynb): Intervention coverage vs efficacy on the percentage of infections averted
* [Figure 3c](cruiseship/simulation/figure3c_efficacy_scenario.ipynb): Percentage of infections averted as a function of treatment efficacy, varying passenger and crew coverage
* [Figures 4a-c](conference/simulation/figure4a-c_network.ipynb): SPHH contact network and weighted contact matrix
* [Figures 4e-h](conference/simulation/figure4e-h_infections_averted.ipynb): Treatment adherence vs dosing regimen, and its impact on the number of infections averted
* [Figure 5](conference/simulation/figure5_protected_vs_unprotected.ipynb): Reduction in individual risk following treatment administration.
